If you want to contribute to the module, feel free to contact me or create an issue. I appreciate suggestions or e.g. translations, that make the module just a bit better.

If you want to specifically add a language to the module I recommend using my module [Translation Editor](https://github.com/kid2407/TranslationEditor) to make your work easier after creating the initial extra file for the language :)
